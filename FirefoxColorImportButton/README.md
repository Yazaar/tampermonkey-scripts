# tampermonkey-scripts > Firefox Color Import Button

# [BIG INSTALL LINK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yazaar/tampermonkey-scripts/master/FirefoxColorImportButton/FirefoxColorImportButton.user.js)

The web browser Firefox got this thing called [Firefox color](https://color.firefox.com) which is dope. With this magical site together with their official addon is browser customization possible. You can export your browser themes but there is no way to import again. Stupid right? **This** tampermonkey script is here to save your day, import any exported theme (theme.zip required). Just install this tampermonkey script and get paste the content of *manifest.json* found inside the exported *theme.zip*. (rightclick and open with your favorite text editor or whatever, then CTRL + A to select everything, then CTRL + C to copy, then import by clicking the import button next to the export button). If Firefox can't figure it out themselves, do it yourself and install this script today (tampermonkey addon required).
